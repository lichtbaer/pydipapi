# OpenAPI Specification

The full OpenAPI specification for the Bundestag API is included in the repository as `pydipapi/openapi.yaml` (not in the docs folder).

If you want to use the OpenAPI spec, download it from the repository and use it with tools like Swagger UI, Postman, or openapi-python-client to generate code or explore the API interactively.
